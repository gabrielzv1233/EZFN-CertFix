## Simple fix to broken internet after using EZFN
**Explanation:**
EZFN creates a proxy for your computer that may not disable if the launcher crashes. This tutorial will help you fix your internet by disabling the proxy.

**Step 1:** Win + R and paste the following command: 
```batch
REG ADD "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings" /v ProxyEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
Press Enter, and thatâ€™s literally it! This should disable the proxy that EZFN creates and will not prevent you from using EZFN in the future. The command also works in CMD.
